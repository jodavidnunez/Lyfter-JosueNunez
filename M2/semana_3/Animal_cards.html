            The Blue Glaucus, also known as the blue dragon, or blue angel.
            Despite its mythical name, the Blue Dragon is actually a type of sea
            slug known as a nudibranch. It floats on the water's surface upside
            down using a gas-filled sac in its stomach for buoyancy. It also
            stores venom from its prey, being capable of mixing different venoms
            from anything it eats.

            Despite their small size, their quick punches have a force of more
            than 1,500 newtons, which can be compared to the force of a .22
            caliber bullet. Mantis shrimp have the best eyes in the animal
            kingdom, being able to see everything humans see plus infrared and
            ultraviolet wave lengths. Mantis shrimps can recognize other mantis
            shrimps through visual cues and even their smell.

          <h1>Archerfish</h1>
          <p>
            Archerfish are known for their ability to shoot water from their
            mouths at a target above the waterâ€™s surface. They do this by
            dilating and contracting their gill covers. The archerfish may also
            move its tail back and forth to aim itself after its target. In
            addition, Archerfish have very sharp eyesight, which is a factor for
            their ability to shoot the water with great accuracy.
